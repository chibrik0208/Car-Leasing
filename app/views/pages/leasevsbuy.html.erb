        <h3 class="lease-vs-buy__benefits-title">Benefits:</h3>
        <ul class="lease-vs-buy__benefits-list">
          <li>Lower Monthly Payments: Leasing often offers lower monthly payments compared to buying, as you're essentially paying for the vehicle's depreciation over the lease term.</li>
          <li>Access to Newer Models: Leasing allows you to drive a new vehicle every few years, enjoying the latest features and technology without the long-term commitment.</li>
          <li>Lower Repair Costs: Since most leased vehicles are under warranty during the lease term, major repairs are typically covered, reducing out-of-pocket expenses.</li>

          <li>Mileage Restrictions: Leases come with mileage limits, and exceeding these limits can result in additional fees.</li>
          <li>No Ownership: You don't own the vehicle at the end of the lease term unless you choose to buy it out.</li>

        <ul class="lease-vs-buy__benefits-list">
          <li>Ownership: When you buy a vehicle, you own it outright after completing the financing payments.</li>
          <li>No Mileage Restrictions: You can drive as much as you want without worrying about mileage penalties.</li>
          <li>Equity Buildup: As you pay off your loan, you build equity in the vehicle, which can be beneficial when you decide to sell or trade it in.</li>

      <div class="lease-vs-buy__considerations">
        <h3 class="lease-vs-buy__considerations-title">Considerations:</h3>
        <ul class="lease-vs-buy__considerations-list">
          <li>Higher Monthly Payments: Monthly payments for buying are generally higher compared to leasing for the same vehicle due to paying off the entire purchase price.</li>
          <li>Depreciation: Vehicles typically depreciate in value over time, affecting their resale value.</li>

      <h2 class="lease-vs-buy__section-title">Making the Decision</h2>
      <p class="lease-vs-buy__section-content">
        Choosing between leasing and buying depends on your financial situation, driving habits, and personal preferences. If you prefer lower monthly payments and enjoy driving new vehicles with minimal maintenance hassle, leasing might be ideal. On the other hand, if you prioritize long-term ownership, customization options, and building equity, buying may be the better choice.
